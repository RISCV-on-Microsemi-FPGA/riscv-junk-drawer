                   SmartFusion2 Cortex-M3 Disable
================================================================================

This project demonstrates how to disable the Cortex-M3 execution.

The Intel-Hex file generated from this project is intented to be used as an NVM
client in the Libero hardware flow. This NVM client should be located at offset
0x00000000 of eNVM in order to be executed by the Cortex-M3 on system reset.

This project can also be used to configure the MDDR memory controller and/or
SERDES block(s) used for Ethernet communications. This can be achieved by
copying the exported firmware configuration generated by Libero into the
drivers_config/sys_config directory of this project and rebuilding.
The configuration of the DDR memory controller and/or SERDES block will take
place as part of the SystemInit() function called before the main() function is
called.

                            How to use this example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Execute this project on a SmartFusion2 Eval Kit programmed with a design
as described in the "Target Hardware" section below. You will see LEDs toggling
on/off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example is targeted at the M2S090 SmartFusion2 Eval Kit and M2S090 Security
Eval Kit.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This example is built to execute on an M2S090 die. You will need to overwrite 
this example project's "drivers_config/sys_config" and "CMSIS" folders with the 
one generated by Libero for your hardware design if using a different silicon
version.
The "drivers_config/sys_config" folder contains information about your hardware
design. This information is used by the CMSIS to initialize clock frequencies
global variables which are used by the SmartFusion2 drivers to derive baud
rates. The CMSIS boot code may also complete the device's clock configuration
depending on silicon version. The "CMSIS" and "drivers_config/sys_config" for
your design can be found in the "firmware" folder of your Libero design.
