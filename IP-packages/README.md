# IP Packages
This folder contains RISC-V IP packages that can be imported into the Libero IP Catalog.
Importing these IP packages will allow adding a RISC-V processor into your FPGA design by selecting the processor of your choice from the IP Catalog in Libero.

### Importing an IP package into Libero
IP packages are imported into Libero using the File->Import->Others menu item and selecting a .cpz IP package file.
For example importing the SiFive_SiFive_SiFiveE31Coreplex_1.0.8.cpz file will result in the SiFiveE31Coreplex becoming availalbe from the processors section of the Libero IP Catalog.
